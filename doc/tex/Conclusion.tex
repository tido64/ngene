\section{Conclusion}

\subsection{Further Work}

\subsubsection{Improvements to Ngene}
There are some aspects of the engine that I would have changed or improved but did not have the time to do so.

\begin{itemize}
	\itemsep=0pt
	\item \textbf{Making the core interchangeable}

	The genetic algorithm itself should be implemented as a separate module, making it possible to change algorithm at any time.

	\item \textbf{Ability to swap modules mid-experiment}

	The possibility to swap modules based on circumstances in a population, for instance, half way through an evolution or when the population is converging.

	\item \textbf{Further optimizations}

	 The use of \texttt{<map>} comes with a penalty as mentioned in chapter~\ref{tbl:speed}. A 3d implementation of a \texttt{vector} should be considered as it would give constant lookup time and negate the need to search for a neighbour element.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Other models}

etc.
