\section{Experiments}
\label{sec:experiments}
Porting the models to the new framework is only the first part of the project. It is also important that these models, once ported, are able to perform in the exact same way as the original code would. The best way to verify that it does, is to repeat a set of experiments and compare the results to the original implementation.

For this purpose, a couple of experiments were picked from a number of papers.

\subsection{Repeating the French flag experiment}
The French flag experiment is one that tries to evolve the French flag. Each cell can either be blue, red or white.
