\section{Experiments}
Porting the models to the new framework is only the first part of the project. It is also important that these models, once ported, are able to perform in the exact same way as they normally would. The best way to check this, is to repeat some experiments and compare the results to the original implementation.

For this purpose, a couple of experiments were picked from a number of papers.
