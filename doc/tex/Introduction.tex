\section{Introduction}
Human's have always been limited in their capacity and knowledge. There are problems that we cannot solve by brain power alone, and this is where computers come into play. Computers can perform millions upon millions of calculations in mere seconds and their power only increases as time goes by. However, computers can only solve problems that humans are able to precisely describe. Most of the times, this works very well. But there is one whole area of computer science that may not be solvable this way. Artifical intelligence 


In the following section, we shall have a look at the two models that have been chosen for this project. We will look at the idea behind them and see how they work. We will also discuss their differences and explain why a framework is necessary.

In section~\ref{sec:implementation}, we shall take a look at the implementation of the framework and the porting of mentioned models. Any changes made during this process will be highlighted and explained. Performance tests will also be conducted to see if any real speed has been gained.

Section~\ref{sec:experiments} will be all about repeating experiments already done in order verify that nothing has been changed except for the code behind. The models should be able to perform just as well as they did.
