\section{Introduction}

TODO

In the following section, we shall have a look at the two models that have been chosen for this project. We will look at the idea behind them and see how they work. We will also discuss their differences and explain why a framework is necessary.

In section~\ref{sec:implementation}, we shall take a look at the implementation of the framework and the porting of mentioned models. Any changes made during this process will be highlighted and explained. Performance tests will also be conducted to see if any real speed has been gained.

Section~\ref{sec:experiments} will be all about repeating experiments already done in order verify that nothing has been changed except for the code behind. The models should be able to perform just as well as they did.
