ngene
=====

Version numbering in ngene works as following:

	1.x.ymmdd

First number is major revision. These are only major changes.

Second number is minor revision. Changed when there are significant changes
like new features or change of library. These days, I'm trying to remove
some dependencies. These are minor revisions.

The last number is the date of build. Usually bug-fixes.

API may change when there is a new minor revision. These will be highlighted.
